# Todo

## Shortcuts
- No perisitence layer/storage
- No security considerations were taken
- No automated testing due to time constraints
- UI is very simple. Many improvements could be made here

## Possible improvements
- If authentication was a requirement I would use JWT
- If persistence was required, I would choose Python SQLAlchemy for ORM to keep things simple ( this app has not got such complex requiremwents )
- If we need to let users choose other currencies or other functions, this could be done by leveraging angular router and a navbar.
- CI/CD would largely depend on how the organisation has chosen to do this. I'm familiar with Jenkins automating such pipelines.
